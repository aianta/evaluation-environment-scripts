    - title: Psychology & Pseudeo Science
      user: instructor
      body: |
        Psychology, as a scientific discipline, is grounded in empirical research and the systematic study of behavior and mental processes. It relies on rigorous methodologies, peer-reviewed evidence, and ethical standards to understand the complexities of the human mind. In contrast, pseudoscience often masquerades as legitimate science but lacks the foundational principles of scientific inquiry—such as falsifiability, reproducibility, and critical peer evaluation. Practices like astrology, phrenology, or certain fringe self-help techniques may claim psychological benefits but typically rely on anecdotal evidence, confirmation bias, or misleading jargon. Distinguishing between psychology and pseudoscience is vital—not just for academic integrity, but for protecting individuals from potentially harmful or exploitative practices disguised as therapeutic truth.

           <p> In psychology, abnormal behavior refers to patterns of emotion, thought, or action that deviate significantly from societal norms and may interfere with daily functioning. This includes behaviors that are distressing to the individual, socially disruptive, or harmful—often manifesting in conditions like anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, or personality disorders. Psychologists assess abnormal behavior by considering factors such as the intensity, duration, and context of symptoms, always accounting for cultural and situational differences. It's not just about what's “unusual”—it's about understanding the deeper psychological, biological, and environmental causes to support effective diagnosis and treatment.</p>

            <p> A personal example of memory distortion occurred when I tried to recall details from a group project meeting last semester. I remembered that one of my teammates suggested a specific approach to data analysis, but later realized that my recollection was influenced by my own preference for that approach rather than what was actually said. This aligns with the concept of reconstructive memory in psychology, which shows that memory is not a perfect recording but rather reconstructed based on prior knowledge, expectations, and biases. This experience made me more aware of how easily memories can be shaped by subjective interpretation and motivated me to take more detailed notes during collaborative work. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for academic accuracy and everyday decision-making. </p>

            <p>One clear example of cognitive bias in my daily life occurred during a family discussion about buying a new car. I strongly believed that electric vehicles were the superior choice, and when looking at reviews online, I only paid attention to the ones that supported my preexisting view. This is an example of confirmation bias, where I sought out information that aligned with my opinion while ignoring contradictory evidence, such as concerns about charging infrastructure or long-term battery costs. By being aware of this bias, I realize I could have made a more balanced and informed judgment by actively seeking opposing viewpoints. Understanding how these biases work is important for making rational decisions in both personal and professional contexts. </p>

            <p> One cognitive bias I have personally experienced is the confirmation bias. While preparing for a debate on the effectiveness of mindfulness in reducing stress, I found myself selectively searching for studies that supported my pre-existing belief that mindfulness is highly effective. Although I encountered some evidence suggesting mixed results, I was more inclined to dismiss or minimize those findings, instead focusing on sources that reinforced my viewpoint. This is consistent with psychological literature that explains how confirmation bias helps maintain cognitive consistency, but can also distort our interpretation of evidence. Recognizing this bias has helped me slow down and evaluate information more critically, which is essential not only for academic work but also for making better decisions in daily life. </p>

            <p>During the final exam period last semester, I felt overwhelmed by the number of tests and deadlines. My initial emotional response was anxiety, paired with physical tension and trouble sleeping. I coped by creating a strict study schedule and practicing short mindfulness exercises before studying. According to Lazarus and Folkman's model of stress and coping, I was using both problem-focused coping (through planning and time management) and emotion-focused coping (through mindfulness to regulate stress levels). Reflecting on this, I recognize that while my strategies were helpful, I could have improved by seeking more social support instead of isolating myself to study. Understanding these theories allows me to refine how I approach stressful events in the future. </p>

            <p> I once forgot an important deadline for submitting a project in my previous course. At the time, I believed I had plenty of time and did not set reminders. When the day arrived, I realized I had completely misremembered the due date. This experience can be explained by the concept of prospective memory, which refers to remembering to perform an intended action in the future. Research suggests that without external cues or intentional rehearsal, prospective memory often fails. Additionally, my memory error was influenced by interference from other tasks I was managing simultaneously, which aligns with the theory of interference in memory research. Reflecting on this experience highlights the importance of strategies like setting reminders and breaking tasks into smaller steps to improve memory performance. </p>

The hypothesis is that students who practice 10 minutes of guided meditation each day for two weeks will show significantly higher scores on a digit span task compared to a control group that does not meditate. Participants would be randomly assigned to either the meditation or control group. The method includes a pre-test and post-test of working memory, with sessions conducted in a quiet room at the university. I expect that the meditation group will demonstrate improved working memory performance, supporting prior research linking mindfulness with cognitive enhancement. </p>

            <p> In their 2018 study, Smith and colleagues investigated the effects of divided attention on memory recall. Participants were asked to memorize a list of words while simultaneously performing a secondary task. Results showed that recall performance decreased significantly under divided attention conditions, supporting the limited capacity model of working memory. The study highlights how multitasking impairs encoding processes, making information less likely to be stored in long-term memory. These findings are especially relevant in educational contexts where students often study while distracted by technology. The authors suggest strategies such as focused attention training to improve memory retention. </p>

            <p> Childhood psychological development is a dynamic process where the foundations of personality, emotional regulation, social skills, and cognitive abilities begin to form. From infancy through adolescence, children navigate stages of attachment, trust-building, autonomy, and identity exploration—each influenced by interactions with caregivers, peers, and their environment. Milestones such as developing language, understanding emotions, and grasping moral reasoning are shaped by both biology and experience. This formative period lays the groundwork for future mental health, relationships, and learning, making early support and nurturing critical for well-rounded development. </p>

            <p> Another vital aspect of childhood psychological development is the formation of executive functions—cognitive skills that include working memory, impulse control, and flexible thinking. These functions begin to take shape in early childhood and are heavily influenced by both brain maturation and life experiences. As children learn to manage their emotions, plan tasks, follow instructions, and shift attention between activities, they gradually develop the self-regulation needed for academic success and social interaction. Structured play, supportive caregiving, and responsive environments help refine these mental tools, setting the stage for independent decision-making and problem-solving throughout life.</p>

            <p>Social interaction is a powerful driver of cognitive development, shaping how individuals acquire knowledge, problem-solving strategies, and cultural norms. Vygotsky's sociocultural theory emphasizes the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), where learners progress through guidance and collaboration with more knowledgeable peers or adults. This framework suggests that learning is inherently social, and cognitive growth is facilitated by communication, dialogue, and shared activity. In contrast, Piaget's stages of development place more emphasis on individual discovery through interaction with the environment. While Piaget acknowledged the importance of peers, he viewed development as a sequence of universal stages rather than a process deeply embedded in social context. Both perspectives highlight the importance of active engagement but differ in how much weight they assign to social influence. Modern research tends to integrate these theories, recognizing that social scaffolding accelerates skill acquisition while individual exploration reinforces deeper understanding. Together, they show that cognitive development is both socially mediated and individually constructed.</p>

            <p> Memory is a central process in learning, as it allows information to be encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. Short-term memory provides a temporary holding space, while working memory actively manipulates information to support problem-solving and reasoning. Long-term memory, on the other hand, stores knowledge and skills for extended periods, making cumulative learning possible. Classic studies, such as Miller's ‘Magic Number 7' and Baddeley's model of working memory, demonstrate how cognitive limitations shape learning efficiency. Reinforcement through practice, meaningful connections, and emotional engagement strengthens long-term retention, highlighting the importance of teaching strategies that align with cognitive psychology principles.</p>
